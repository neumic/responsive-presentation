Responsive Design using Bootstrap

-What Responsive Design is:
	1) A way of designing web interfaces so that they adapt or respond the layout to fit the 'view-port'.
	2) A buzz word that pops up in client and presales conversations causing anguish and distress and 32 hour estimates.
	3) Not really that hard, if you start with it in mind. (on the Dev side of things)
	4) Basically, at it's core, Responsive Design is really just creating 3-4 layouts for the same content.

-What Responsive Design isn't:
	1) "Make it look exactly the same in all browsers and operating systems."
	2) "Make it look completely different on a mobile screen."
	3) A purely Dev task ("Make the home screen responsive")
